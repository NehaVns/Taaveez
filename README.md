# Project - LegalBridge

### Tired of waiting for Legal- Aid?    Wait NO MORE!!!     LegalBridge is here to help.


A multilingual legal services application that connects users with diverse legal service providers, making legal assistance accessible and affordable. The Legal Services Application is designed to break down barriers to accessing legal support by providing a user-friendly platform where users can connect with legal service providers from various backgrounds.

# 📜App Description
 
The application primarily solves the following five challenges faced in the legal sector in India:-
+ Unorganized legal sector
+ Linguistic Barrier 
+ Lack of transparency
+ Ensuring quality service
+ Uniform pricing across legal services


## 🌐Language

The application is **multilingual**, allowing users to communicate with legal service providers in their preferred language. This inclusivity ensures that users across India can access legal assistance in their native language. The text-to-speech synthesizer is a real help for illiterate parts of India.
